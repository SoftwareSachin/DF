# Deep Fake Detection System - AI-Powered

## Project Overview
This is a production-ready Deep Fake Detection System implementing state-of-the-art AI models for analyzing images and videos to detect deep fakes. The system features a modern React frontend with a FastAPI backend, using multiple detection techniques including neural networks, frequency domain analysis, and advanced facial landmark detection.

## Current Setup
- **Frontend**: React TypeScript application with Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI server with AI detection models
- **Architecture**: Single-port deployment (FastAPI serves both API and frontend)
- **Python Version**: 3.11.13
- **Node.js Version**: 20
- **Host**: 0.0.0.0 (configured for Replit proxy)
- **Port**: 5000
- **Status**: âœ… Working with React + FastAPI

## AI Models & Features
- **ðŸŽ¯ Ensemble Detection**: Multi-model approach combining all techniques for maximum accuracy
- **âš¡ EfficientNet-B0**: Lightweight CNN model with transfer learning from ImageNet
- **ðŸ“± MobileNet-V2**: Mobile-optimized neural network for fast inference
- **ðŸŒŠ Frequency Analysis**: FFT-based digital artifact detection with DCT analysis
- **ðŸ‘¤ MediaPipe Face Analysis**: Advanced facial landmark detection with 468 key points
- **ðŸ”¬ Geometric Analysis**: Facial symmetry and proportion analysis for authenticity
- **ðŸ“Š Real-time Confidence Scoring**: Multi-dimensional confidence assessment
